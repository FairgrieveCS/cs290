  DESIGN:
While looking through online courses and help I always see weather apps
as a common intro project to web developement. I've tried creating one in the past
in Python and didn't end up completing it so I thought it would be a great time to give
it another go in JS. I used OpenWeatherMap API (as thats the one i used in the past).
You just type the city name into an input field and click a search button, and the app 
will use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data for that city. The app will
then display the current weather and a forecast for the next few days in two separate 
sections on the web page.
