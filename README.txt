List of five websites:

1.) I'm not an Apple product consumer, but Apple's website is beautifully designed - https://www.apple.com/
2.) The world's worst website is hilarious because it is intentionally designed to be awful in every way possible - https://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/
3.) Twitch is a very functional and nice looking website with your followed channels listed on the left hand bar and easily searchable/browsable content - https://www.twitch.tv/
4.) Internet Archive's way back machine is a fun and simple tool to easily view the internet from the past - https://archive.org/web/
5.) Google Maps is one of my favorite websites that quickly, accurately, and easily allows any user to navigate or view the world (I also really enjoy playing Geoguessr) - https://www.google.com/maps/ - https://www.geoguessr.com/
